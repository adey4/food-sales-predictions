# Predicting item sales 
## Creating a model to predict item sales based on item and outlet info

**Author**: Ankit Dey

### Business problem:

The purpose of this project is to create a model to predict item sales based on information about the item (e.g. MRP, weight) and the outlet where it is sold. This model can then be used to help understand how to drive growth in sales.


### Data:
Data was sourced from Big Mart's sales data in 2013, containing 1559 items sold across 10 outlets. The dataset contains 7 categorical variables and 5 numerical variables, all representing relevant information about an item or its outlet.


## Methods Used
- Data mining
- Data cleaning
  - Item_Weight and Outlet_Size columns were missing 17.2% and 28.3% of their rows, respectively. Item_Weight is a continuous numerical variable with no large outliers, so mean values were imputed in missing rows. Outlet_Size is an ordinal variable, so missing rows were imputed with the most frequent outlet size.
- Exploratory analyses
- Machine Learning
- Predictive modeling (linear regression, decision tree)
